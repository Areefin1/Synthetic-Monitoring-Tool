# Ping Monitor web application using Python, Flask, Prometheus, and Grafana.

Ping Monitor is a web application that enables real-time monitoring of network performance. It allows users to configure and configure pings, collect metrics like packets sent/received, packet loss, and round-trip time, and store them in a Prometheus time-series database. Grafana visualizes these metrics, providing valuable insights into network health and performance.
